description: Books To Read About High Frequency Trading 
---
[Flash Boys](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24724602-flash-boys) is a dreadful book on HFT.  It is inaccurate and biased.  More problematic is that the plot struggles to make sense.  You are quite literally better off **NOT** reading Flash Boys if you want to learn about High Frequency Trading.

If you must read Flash Boys, you should also read [Flash Boys: Not So Fast](http://www.amazon.com/Flash-Boys-Insiders-Perspective-High-Frequency-ebook/dp/B00P0QI2M2/ref=pd_sim_kstore_3?ie=UTF8&refRID=0P13P4PAC19BW5FB29WE).  This can be seen as a counterpoint or study guide from someone who actually knows how HFT works.

For narrative non-fiction a much better book is [Dark Pools](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12917124-dark-pools).  It also has some inaccuracies and biases, but it is not nearly as incoherent as Flash Boys.

If you are interested in more technical reading:

- [Trading And Exchanges](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1290158.Trading_and_Exchanges) by Harris.  This is a good, though slightly outdated, guide to how Exchanges, Order Books, and microstructure trades work.
- [Algorithmic Trading And DMA](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7346602-algorithmic-trading-and-dma) by Johnson.  A good introduction to writing direct market access algorithms.
